# CSGO market bot

This bot crawls the steam marketplace for knives in Counter strike global offensive.
Built with python it gets a render api call from steams website containing price information about knives.
It then detects if a knive is cheaper than normal by parsing the information and checking against a threshold (30).

The program also sends you an email and opens a tab in the browser with the item.

**This program does not help you buy the item**
